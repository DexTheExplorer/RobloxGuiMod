If it doesn't open in a folder named "version-xxxxxxxxxxxx", try again or navigate to the folder manually.

It's time to clone the files into the directory. You can do this by running `git clone https://github.com/vaxx-y/RobloxGuiMod`.

You are now able to install the mod by running `cd RobloxGuiMod && installAdditions.cmd`. If you get a Windows SmartScreen warning, press "Show More" and then "Run anyway"
Follow the steps that the command prompt window tells you to do.

### OPTIONAL
To fully recolor all of the UI, you can use a script executor to run the file that it dropped on your desktop.

**NOTE: DOING THE OPTIONAL STEP MIGHT GET YOU BANNED.**
